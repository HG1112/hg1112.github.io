#####Objective:
  - Stop reinventing wheel for bigdata development between different teams within the organization
  - Generate a software library/framework providing abstractions and tools to ease their dev lifecyle

#####Approach:
  - Consulted different teams to know their needs
  - Gathered a list of
  	- tools (like CICD pipelines, build files, Nexus,..) 
	- abstractions (like IO utils, config parsers,..)
  - Minimal software design leaving out scope for more features to be added
  - Adoption of most common used design patterns - functional and object-oriented basing on the problem statement

#####Results:
  - Small portable framwork to incorporate in any bigdata project
  - Supports Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Hbase, MongoDB, ... and other bigdata technologies
  - Adds support of automation with scripting and devops tools like docker, jenkins, maven/gradle/sbt,...
